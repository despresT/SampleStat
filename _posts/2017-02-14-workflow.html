How you organise yourself when doing R will make it easier for you if
you need to go back to your script weeks or years after, and to share
with others people.
</p>

<p>
There is different workflow that you can do. At first, when I was
working on a project, I was using a simple folder named <code>analyses</code> and
put everything in it with obscure name such as <code>spatial analyses.R</code> or
<code>canopy area analyses.R</code>, etc. I was also putting all the outputs
(Figures, tables, maps) in the same working directory as the .R scripts.
</p>

<p>
I think, this make it harder to find again some figures that you did
made.
</p>

<p>
Now I am using since a couple of year another workflow. I first used
number before each names to know which script I need to run at first
like <code>1 data upload.R</code>, <code>2 function point pattern.R</code> and <code>3 final
results.R</code>.
</p>

<p>
For the outputs, I have <code>.RData</code> saving files in the working directory,
but all my Figures are in different folder. Thus, for example, I have
a path like this <code>./living/NA/normal/replicate/Lmm graph/</code> with every
figures of the L_mm functions (a spatial pattern function) for the
replicate normal NA (no marks) and living patterns. 
</p>

<p>
I have a little script that help in R for checking if the path is here
and make a new folder or not if it already exist.
</p>

<p>
Here is the little script will check for the path <code>/Project X/Analyses/results RandomForest</code>:
</p>

{% highlight R %}
mainDir <- "/Project X/Analyses"#path do the main folder without "/" to the end
  

if (file.exists(file.path(mainDir, "results RandomForest"))) {
                        setwd(file.path(mainDir, "results RandomForest"))
                    } else {
                        dir.create(file.path(mainDir, "results RandomForest"), showWarnings = FALSE,recursive=TRUE)
                        setwd(file.path(mainDir, "results RandomForest"))
                    }
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
You can even add it in a <code>for</code> loop like this:
</p>

{% highlight R %}
mainDir <- "/Project X/Analyses"#path do the main folder without "/" to the end
#you can use here 
# mainDir <- getwd() # to have this script work
setwd(mainDir) 
variables_names <- c("temperature","slope","patterns")
for (i in variables_names) {
    library(ggplot2)
    library(ggthemes)

    if (file.exists(file.path(mainDir, "results RandomForest",i))) {
        setwd(file.path(mainDir, "results RandomForest",i))
    } else {
        dir.create(file.path(mainDir, "results RandomForest",i), showWarnings = FALSE,recursive=TRUE)
        setwd(file.path(mainDir, "results RandomForest",i))
    }
    ## making a empty graph and save it
    ggplot() +
        geom_text() +
        annotate("text", label = paste0("text with variables names  ",i ), x = 2, y = 15, size = 8, fontface = "bold") +
        theme_few() +
        ggsave(paste0("variables", "_", i,".pdf"))

    setwd(mainDir) #here very important to set the mainDir working directory again
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Here it will check for three different paths in the same subfolder
<code>results RandomForest</code>
</p>

<p>
<code>/Project X/Analyses/results RandomForest/temperature</code>
</p>

<p>
<code>/Project X/Analyses/results RandomForest/slope</code>
</p>

<p>
<code>/Project X/Analyses/results RandomForest/patterns</code>
</p>

<p>
and save in each folder a file names <code>varialbes_temperature.pdf</code> (or slope.pdf
or patterns.pdf) in the folder temperature (or slope or patterns).
</p>

<p>
The outputs figures should look like this:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><a href="/assets/data/variables_temperature.jpg" width="800"><img src="/assets/data/variables_temperature.jpg" alt="variables_temperature.jpg" width="800"/></a>
</p>
</div>
