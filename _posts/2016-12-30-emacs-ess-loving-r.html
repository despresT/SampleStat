Since my second year of university I have studied Statistic with R on Windows using
the basic text editor from the R GUI console. I was happy with it for a
couple of years. However, when I start coding more complex and longer
function, it was a nightmare to handle human issues, specially
parentheses tracking. A professor told me that they were some programs
specific to code in R, such as <a href="http://nbcgib.uesc.br/lec/software/editores/tinn-r/en">Tinn-R</a> or the well known <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">R-Studio</a>. I
also found that Notepad++ as a plugin (<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/npptor/">nppToR</a>) to link the text
editor to R. However, after trying R-Studio and Notepad++, I was not
very happy with them. I always did not like the multi-windows
design from R-Studio, and Notepad++ was only a better way to use
the script function from the R GUI. It was not fully integrated
R. Finally, my professor told me about Emacs, and how it was working
with R. I first try it with Windows, using the very good
<a href="http://vgoulet.act.ulaval.ca/en/emacs/">Emacs version from Vincent Goulet</a>. It was exactly what I was looking for. A software
that can interact with R without a lot of windows, and well integrated
with R. Few years later, I jump to Linux using first Manjaro (an
ArchLinux distribution), and after Xubuntu to keep the very good XFCE
desktop environment.

For the reader who don't know anything about <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> this is a free
software from the GNU licence which can speak R using <a href="https://ess.r-project.org/">ESS</a> package (for Emacs
Speaks Statistic). But Emacs did not speak only statistic, this is an
incredible tool that can speak multiple computers languages, read your
email and much more. In fact, I am writing this blog article using
Emacs through  <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org-mode</a>. Emacs is a cross-platform program which can
be used with Windows or Mac Os, and also Linux.

I will put more articles in this blog describing how I am using Emacs
with R, and for blogging, and hopefully you will consider it to use
for your own projects.
