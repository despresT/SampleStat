<p>
Using loop with R is not the proper behaviour to have. Indeed,
using the apply functions family such as <i>tapply</i>, <i>lapply</i>, and so
one are a better way to do it, but for me, this is in some case too
complicated.
The apply family functions improve the speed rate of T and the management of the memory. Thus,  apply functions is relevant to use when you have big data-set to play with.
Instead of using apply functions, I used <code>for</code> loop. This is simpler to understand it  for me and with moderate data-set (about few thousand of rows and 100 columns) the gain of apply functions is limited.
Like this, <code>for</code> loop can be read again quickly even when you comeback to your code years later.
I will now provide a small example to understand when you can use <code>for</code> loop and how to used them.  Also, note that understanding <code>for</code> loop will lead to use <code>foreach</code> function which allow parallelisation computing. It will be explain in another post.
</p>

<p>
So, let's begin the <code>for</code> loop example.
I will show you how to do spaghetti plot from tree ring data.

<p>
Every year, tree make rings. We can count them to have the tree
age, and also measure them to know a little more about the tree
and its story. Indeed, tree increment (ring width from a year to
another) give information on past climate, past disturbances
(pest, drought, fire, ice and wind storms, etc.). 
</p>

<p>
In this data set(<a href="/assets/data/tree rings increment.txt">tree rings increment</a>) you will find tree rings
increment [in mm] from 19
different trees (V1 to V19). The NA value is for year without
increment information for this tree (it was not born), and the row
#270 is for AD 2011  and the row #1 for AD 1741.
</p>

<p>
The data look like this:
</p>
{% highlight R %}
setwd("./assets/data/") # change following your own working directory
library(data.table) #load data.table at least V.1.10 (to have fread function)
increment_data <- fread("tree rings increment.txt")

##if you did not want to use data.table V1.10 (which allow the fread function use the following code
#increment_data <- read.table("tree rings increment.txt",sep=";",h=T) #for your data,
#Because trees have not the same age, there is a lot of NA value and the length of
#your data frame is equal to the year of the oldest trees (for me it was a tree not show in this sub-sample).
#print(increment_data[1:3])

increment_data[, .(V1,V2,V3)]

<p>
We are now going to plot each tree starting from their first year of
growth record (i.e. the closest year to the row #1), and then continue
until the year AD 2011 (i.e. row #270). 
Because in data-set there is no year with 0 of increment, we need to
add it for each trees using the following code example for one tree: 
</p>

{% highlight R %}
    # the 3 following code line are just to help to generate the graphic frame
increment_data_unique <- increment_data[,1]
increment_data_unique <- increment_data_unique[complete.cases(increment_data_unique) ]
increment_data_unique <- rbind(list(0),increment_data_unique)
# I am pretty sure that those 3 lines of code are not required.
as.data.table(increment_data_unique)
{% endhighlight %}

<pre class="example">
	    V1
     1:   0.00
     2:   0.71
     3:   1.64
     4:   2.07
     5:   2.46

   137: 128.99
   138: 130.45
   139: 131.54
   140: 132.25
   141: 132.76
</pre>
<p>
Here we can see that we remove all NA value, and put a 0.00 value for
the first year of growth of the tree
</p>



<p>
Because we need to do it for each 19 trees, this is easier to do it
within a <code>for</code> loop like this:
</p>

{% highlight R %}
#pdf("Multiplot radial growth sugar maple between 150 and 160 years old.pdf", width=12, height=8) #to save the plot as PDF

plot(as.numeric(rownames(increment_data_unique))-1,increment_data_unique[[1]],xlab="Age [in years]",
     ylab="radial growth [in mm]",main="Radial growth of 19 trees between 150 and 160 yrs",
     type="n",ylim=c(0,250),xlim=c(0,165)) #generate just the frame of the graphic to have all the same scale

for (i in names(increment_data)) { #for loop to draw one by one, each line of tree increments, starting all in age 0
 #use of names(increment_data) to have the names of each trees from "V1" to "V19"

    increment_data_unique <-increment_data[,i,with=F]#with=FALSE to have the whole column
    increment_data_unique <- as.data.frame(increment_data_unique[complete.cases(increment_data_unique), ]) #remove all the NA value
    increment_data_unique <- rbind(0,increment_data_unique) # add the 0 mm of DBH to start all tree at 0 years-old, 0 DBH
    par(new=TRUE) #allow to combine plots
    plot(as.numeric(rownames(increment_data_unique))-1,increment_data_unique[[1]],xlab="Age [in years]",
         ylab="radial growth [in mm]",
         main="Radial growth of 19 trees between 150 and 160 yrs",type="l",ylim=c(0,250),xlim=c(0,165)) #draw the plots for a single tree.
    #then restart the loop with the next tree, etc.
}
#dev.off() # save the graphic in your directory

{% endhighlight %}
