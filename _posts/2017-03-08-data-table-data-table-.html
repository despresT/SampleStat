When you are doing a lot of R, you can find two different kind of
people, the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html">dplyr</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki">data.table</a> people. Indeed, those to packages
are used for table manipulation. They are like the <a href="http://ggplot2.org/">ggplot2</a> function
 for graphic, when you know them  they change
your R experience and you cannot go back.

I will not talk a lot about <code>dplyr</code> package, because I am not using
it. However, you need to know few things about it. Usually, <code>dplyr</code> is
used with another package named <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr">tidyr</a>, and since recently, you
can find one package which will load both of them and more (load also
<code>ggplot2</code>, <code>readr</code>, etc.) and named <a href="https://blog.rstudio.org/2016/09/15/tidyverse-1-0-0/">tidyverse</a>.
</p>

<p>
To be simple, <code>dplyr</code> is very useful to handle object, and specially for
sorting, sub-sample, etc. thanks to the new operator <code>%&gt;%</code>.
This operator will pipe object to another line to make more change on
it. It is very convenient to avoid typing multiple times the object
names like this:
</p>

{% highlight R %}
set.seed(121)
data <- rnorm(10)
data <- data + 44

# With dplyr package
library(dplyr)
set.seed(121)
data2 <- rnorm(10) %>%
    + 44

identical(data,data2)

{% endhighlight %}

<pre class="example">
TRUE
</pre>

<p>
But, there is a lot of very nice function with <code>dplyr</code> to select,
sub.select, sort, replace data from tables.
</p>

<p>
If you are using emacs, you can define a key-bind for <code>%&gt;%</code>. Here is the
lisp code you will need to put in your .emacs config file. 
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
;;Define shortcut key for %>% function
(global-set-key (kbd "<M-f5>") 'dplyr-function)
(defun dplyr-function ()
  (interactive)
  (insert " %>%"))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Thus, in my example, the shortcut will be Meta (Alt) - f5. Of 
course, you can change it for whatever you like, just be sure that
your shortcut is not already use.
</p>

<p>
You will find a lot of site to learn more of the <code>dplyr</code> package on
internet. The user community is large and you will find a lot of
question/answer in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dplyr">stackoverflow</a> from the <code>dplyr</code> package.

I started using <code>data.table</code> a couple of years ago. At first, this is very
hard and the syntax is counter-intuitive, but you will use to it.
The <code>data.table</code> function is known to be faster than the <code>dplyr</code> package,
but the difference of speed will only be consequent for huge data set
(millions or rows and hundred of columns).
</p>

<p>
<code>data.table</code> use less verbose than <code>dplyr</code> but is more complex to write in
my opinion. Here is some examples (<a href="/assets/data/data_plot_scale.txt">the data are here</a>):
</p>


{% highlight R %}
library(data.table)

data_plot_pat <- fread("data_plot_scale.txt") #read the data
data_plot_pat
dim(data_plot_pat)

{% endhighlight %}

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-right" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-right">1548</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-right">6</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


{% highlight R %}
setkey(data_plot_pat, Status, mark)#set in the data table "data_plot_pat" first the Status, and then the mark

selected_plot  <- data_plot_pat[Status == "living" & mark == "DBH"] [, .( Stand_ID.m,lng, lat, pattern_state)]#select plot with living status and DBH mark 
# and then subset only the Stand__ID_m name, lng, lat and pattern_state
print(dim(selected_plot))

{% endhighlight %}

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-right" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-right">504</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-right">4</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>
And you can add 
</p>
{% highlight R %}
selected_plot[,  lat :=  lat + 100 ]#make some change on a existed vector. Here add 100 for each row on the "lat" vector

selected_plot[,  new_colmun :=  "repeated text"]#add a new column with the same value for each row (here this is "repeated text", but it could be numeric as well.
print(dim(selected_plot))

{% endhighlight %}

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-right" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-right">504</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-right">5</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
As you can see, here there is a new column.
</p>


<p>
And if you are using emacs and R, I suggest you to add the following package in
your <code>.emacs</code> for the function <code>:=</code> to have space between it, you can add
this code:
</p>

{% highlight cl %}
;; Electric operator will turn a=10*5+2 into a = 10 * 5 + 2, so letâ€™s enable it for R
(use-package electric-operator
  :ensure t
  :config
  (setq electric-operator-R-named-argument-style 'spaced)
  (add-hook 'ess-mode-hook #'electric-operator-mode))
(electric-operator-add-rules-for-mode 'ess-mode
  (cons ":=" " := "))
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Also, the electric-operator will make you code easier to read by
adding space between operator such as " == ", or " + ", etc.
</p>


<p>
Because I am used to <code>data.table</code> and specially love the <code>fread</code> and
<code>fwrite</code> function to read and save tables, I did not want to use
<code>dplyr</code>. However, if you are a beginner, or you want to read old code
easily years later, I suggest you to use <code>dplyr</code>.
