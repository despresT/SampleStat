  <b>Sample Stat</b> is a blog about <b>Statistic</b> in ecology.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
  <h2 id="sec-1">What you can expect:</h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
    <ul class="org-ul">
      <li>Posts should be at least every two weeks. 
      </li>
      <li>Posts are about Statistic, R and Emacs tips, and also time to time
	about forest ecology, my main field.
	<p>

	  long tutorials and thought on
	  Statistic,  R, and more generally about my work flow and the
	  softwares I use in Linux.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>

	  then, step by step put more complex contents.

      </li>
    </ul>
