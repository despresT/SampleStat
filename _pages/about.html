<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">What you can expect:</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Posts should be at least every two weeks on Monday. 
</li>
<li>Posts are about Statistic, R and Emacs tips, and also time to time
  about forest ecology, my main field.
<p>

  Within this constraint you  can expect some tutorials and thought on
  Statistic,  R, and more generally about wy work flow and the
  softwares I used in Linux.

</ul>

NB. All the posts will be writing using org-mode in Emacs (thanks to
