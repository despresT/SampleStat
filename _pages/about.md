**Sample Stat** is a blog about **Statistic** in ecology.

What you can expect:
--------------------

-   Posts should be at least every two weeks on Monday.
-   Posts are about Statistic, R and Emacs tips, and also time to time about forest ecology, my main field.

    Within this constraint you can expect some tutorials and thought on Statistic, R, and more generally about wy work flow and the softwares I used in Linux.

-   NB. All the posts will be writing using org-mode (Thanks to [Malabarba](https://github.com/Malabarba/ox-jekyll-subtree)).
